## Deployment

### Railway Deployment (Recommended) ðŸš€

Railway is the recommended platform for this application as it supports the complex build requirements for face recognition.

1. **Sign up for Railway**: Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. **Connect GitHub**: Link your GitHub account
3. **Deploy from GitHub**:
   - Click "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Select your repository
   - Railway will auto-detect the project
4. **Deploy**: Railway will build and deploy automatically

**Railway Configuration:**
- **Requirements file**: `requirements.txt` (automatically detected)
- **Main file**: `app.py` (automatically detected)
- **Port**: Railway handles `$PORT` automatically
- **Configuration**: `railway.json` provides optimized settings

## Usage

1. **Register Students**: Go to "Register Student" and fill in student details with a face photo
2. **Mark Attendance**: Use either "QR Attendance" or "Face Attendance" to mark attendance
3. **View Records**: Check "View Attendance" to see all attendance records with photos

## Troubleshooting

### Railway Deployment Issues

#### Build Timeout
- **Error**: Build takes too long or times out
- **Solution**: Railway has generous build limits, but if issues persist, check the build logs for specific errors

#### Face Recognition Installation Issues
- **Error**: `dlib` or `face-recognition` installation fails
- **Solution**: Railway's build environment should handle this automatically. If issues persist, check the build logs

#### Memory Issues
- **Error**: Out of memory during build
- **Solution**: Railway provides adequate memory for builds. Contact Railway support if persistent issues occur

### Application Issues

- **Face Recognition Issues**: Ensure good lighting and clear face photos
- **QR Code Not Detected**: Make sure QR code is clearly visible and well-lit
- **Camera Access**: Grant camera permissions when prompted
- **Database Errors**: Ensure write permissions in the application directory
